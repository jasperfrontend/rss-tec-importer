# RSS TEC Importer

A WordPress plugin that reads an RSS feed generated by [The Events Calendar](https://theeventscalendar.com/) on a remote site and imports each item as a native event on the local site.

This replicates the core function of TEC's paid **Event Aggregator** add-on, purpose-built for a single RSS source. After developing this, I now also understand why they charge money for this.

## Requirements

- WordPress 6.0+
- PHP 8.0+
- [The Events Calendar](https://wordpress.org/plugins/the-events-calendar/) (free version is sufficient)

---

## Installation

1. Upload the `rss-tec-importer` folder to `/wp-content/plugins/`
2. Activate the plugin through **Plugins > Installed Plugins**
3. Go to **Settings > RSS TEC Importer** and enter the feed URL

---

## Configuration

| Setting | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| **Feed URL** | The Events Calendar RSS feed URL from the source site | _(empty)_ |
| **Import Schedule** | How often WP-Cron checks for new events | Daily |
| **Default Event Duration** | End time offset when the feed has no end date | 1 hour |
| **Post Status** | Whether imported events are published or saved as drafts | Draft |
| **On Re-import** | Update existing events on subsequent imports, or skip them | Skip |

Settings are saved under the option key `rss_tec_importer_settings`.

## How It Works

1. On a configured schedule (or via the **Import Now** button), the plugin fetches the RSS feed.
2. Each `<item>` is parsed:
   - `<pubDate>` is used as the event **start date** — this is how TEC's own RSS feed works.
   - The first `<img>` in the item description is sideloaded into the media library and set as the event's featured image.
   - The image tag is stripped from the post content to avoid duplication.
   - End time is calculated by adding the configured duration to the start time.
3. Events are deduplicated by GUID (`_rss_tec_source_guid` post meta). On subsequent runs, existing events are either skipped or updated depending on the setting.
4. Run results (created / updated / skipped counts) and the last error, if any, are shown in the **Status Box** at the top of the settings page.

## WP-Cron Note

WordPress cron is traffic-driven — it only fires when someone visits the site. On low-traffic sites the schedule may lag. To use real system cron instead:

**1. Disable WP-Cron in `wp-config.php`:**
```php
define( 'DISABLE_WP_CRON', true );
```

**2. Add a system cron job (runs every 15 minutes):**
```bash
*/15 * * * * wget -q -O /dev/null https://yoursite.com/wp-cron.php?doing_wp_cron
```
Or with WP-CLI:
```bash
*/15 * * * * wp cron event run --due-now --path=/var/www/yoursite
```

## Data Stored

| Option | Contents |
|---|---|
| `rss_tec_importer_settings` | All plugin settings |
| `rss_tec_importer_last_run` | Unix timestamp of last run |
| `rss_tec_importer_last_result` | Array of `created`, `updated`, `skipped` counts |
| `rss_tec_importer_last_error` | Last error message, if any |

Post meta added to each imported event:

| Meta key | Contents |
|---|---|
| `_rss_tec_source_guid` | RSS item GUID (used for deduplication) |
| `_rss_tec_source_image_url` | Original image URL (used to detect changes) |

All options are removed from the database when the plugin is deleted.
